 Following is the class structure of the Node class:

 class Node {
     public int data;
     public Node next;

     Node()
     {
         this.data = 0;
         this.next = null;
     }
     Node(int data)
     {
         this.data = data;
         this.next = null;
     }
     Node(int data, Node next)
     {
         this.data = data;
         this.next = next;
     }
 }

 *****************************************************************/

public class Solution
{
    public static Node reverseLinkedList(Node head)
    {
        // Write your code here.
        Node currentHead = head;
        Node previousHead = null;
        Node nextHead = null;
        while(currentHead != null){
           nextHead = currentHead.next; //currentHead.next points towards nextHead initially
           currentHead.next = previousHead; // points to null
           previousHead = currentHead; // points towards currentHead
           currentHead = nextHead;
        }
        return previousHead;
    }

    
    O(N) time complexity , O(1) space compplexity

    some errors / understanding 

    1. initally i had currentHead = currentHead.next instead of nextHead , this is wrong as 
    You are updating currHead incorrectly, as you're using currHead.next after already changing
    it in the current iteration.
    In the loop, you already store the next node in nextHead, so you should use nextHead to move forward to the next node instead of currHead.next.


    2. why return prevHead and not head

    you're returning the original head instead of the new head after the reversal.
    When the linked list is reversed, the original head is no longer valid as the first node. 
    The correct node to return is previousHead, which will be the new head of the reversed list.

   * currentHead moves through the list, and each node’s next pointer is reversed.
   * previousHead keeps track of the new head as we reverse the links.
   * The loop ends when currentHead reaches the end of the list, and we return 
     previousHead as the new head of the reversed list.
