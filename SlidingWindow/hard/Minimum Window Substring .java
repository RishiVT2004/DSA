class Solution {
    public String minWindow(String a, String b) {
       
        /*
            a = "abcd" ; b = "bd"
            min size of windoe => 2
            windows(len=2) => [[a,b],c,d],[a,[b,c],d],[a,b,[c,d]]
            windows(len=3) => [[a,b,c],d] , [a,[b,c,d]] -> this is the correct answer
            ans -: bcd

            I was able to understand the logic and how the pointers would work , when the 
            windows would slide and when windows will increase in size , 
            but i was unable to implement this in code as i didn't understand how to 
            properly search and return the strings

        // to be attempted after stacks 
    }
}
